# Retirement Robo Advisor
## Background
As a digital transformation consultant for a prominent retirement plan provider, the goal is to increase the client portfolio by engaging young people. To achieve this, a robo advisor will be created using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to disrupt finance and improve the customer experience. The robo advisor will provide investment portfolio recommendations for retirement to both existing and potential customers.

## Project Overview
The robo advisor will be built using Amazon Lex, AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3. Amazon Lex is a service for building conversational interfaces using voice and text. AWS Lambda is a service for running code in response to events and Amazon S3 is a service for storing and retrieving data.

## The robo advisor will have the following features:

* Greet the user and provide information about the robo advisor
* Ask the user about their age
* Ask the user about their income
* Ask the user about their investment amount
* Ask the user about their risk level
* Recommend an investment portfolio based on the user's inputs

## Prerequisites
* AWS Account
* Python 3.7
* AWS CLI

## Installation
1.Clone the repository
2.  Create an AWS Lambda function to serve as the fulfillment function
3. Create an Amazon Lex bot and configure the intents, slots, and fulfillment
4. Build and test the bot using the Amazon Lex console
5. Deploy the bot to production

## Usage
The robo advisor can be accessed by logging in to the Amazon Lex console and testing the bot. The robo advisor will prompt the user for their age, income, investment amount, and risk level. Based on the user's inputs, the robo advisor will recommend an investment portfolio for retirement.
